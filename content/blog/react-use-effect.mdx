A pure component only interacts with itself and its children. Any time you need to interact with the world outside your component, you are dealing with _side-effects_.

React gives us a handy hook for dealing with these. the `React.useEffect` hook lets us specify a function that deals with external forces, provide a second function to clean up after it, and drop a list of dependencies so we can re-run the effect when one of the dependencies change.

## Updating the page title

This effect will run the first time the component is rendered, and then only ever run again if the title has changed.

```js numbered
const [title, setTitle] = React.useState('Hooks 101')

React.useEffect(() => {
  document.title = title
}, [title])
```

## Fetching data from an API into local state.

Since our state changing will not affect the list of products that is returned, we can pass an empty array `[]` as our dependency so that the effect will only run when the component is first mounted.

```js numbered
const [products, setProducts] = React.useState([])

React.useEffect(() => {
  getProducts().then((products) => {
    setProducts(products)
  })
}, [])
```

## Fetching data from an API into local state, based on a query.

If we have a query or filter to modify the set of API data we want, then we can pass it as a dependency to make sure that React runs this effect every time the component renders using a new query.

```js numbered
const [products, setProducts] = React.useState([])
const [query, setQuery] = React.useState('')

React.useEffect(() => {
  getProducts({name: query}).then((products) => {
    setProducts(products)
  })
}, [query])
```

## Dispatching a Redux action.

If your GET action already reduces into your Redux state, then you don't need to maintain any of that locally.

By passing `products.length` as a dependency, you only run this

```js numbered
const dispatch = Redux.useDispatch()
const products = Redux.useSelector((state) => state.products)

React.useEffect(() => {
  dispatch(GetProducts())
}, [])
```
