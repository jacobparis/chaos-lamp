HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, and it's the code that browsers have been using to display websites since it was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990.

Web developers don't always write the HTML directly anymore. There are a lot of advanced tools and other languages that can be used to compile (transform) different kinds of code into the standard HTML that web browsers expect.

But you **can** write HTML directly, and a healthy knowledge of HTML fundamentals will help you excel with the web platform no matter what technology you're working with.

## What it looks like

Webpages are made of "tags" that tell the browser how to display the page. Most tags can be opened `<html>` and closed `</html>` and their contents are anything between the open and close tags.

In the code below, the `html` tag opens on line 1 and closes on line 5.

```html numbered {1,5}
<html>
  <head></head>

  <body></body>
</html>
```

Everything between is indented to show that it's **inside**<SideNote>We would describe this relationship by saying that `<head>` and `<body>` are children of `<html>`, and that `<head>` and `<body>` are siblings of each other. It follows that `<html>` would be the parent of each.</SideNote> the `html` tag.

Children can have their own children, so we can put a `<title>` inside `<head>` and we can put regular text inside the `<title>`

```html numbered {3}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Why I like to travel</title>
  </head>

  <body></body>
</html>
```

Notice how `<head> </head>` has been split into two lines here.

Try to make sure your open and close tags line up either vertically (same indent level) or horizontally (same line)

Spaces and line breaks don't matter much in HTML, so they're usually stripped out during file compression to save bandwidth. That's not something you have to do yourself, but it's easier to read and write HTML<SideNote>HTML is based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). This tag format with pairs of `<tag>` and `</tag>` to open and close, as well as the self-closing format of `<tag />`, comes from XML.</SideNote> if you indent every time you open a tag.

## The tags

There are lots of different tags that you'll learn soon.

`<html>`
: Marks the page as an HTML document. This will wrap your entire website, and there is only ever one of these.

`<head>`
: Contains extra information about your site. Nothing inside here ends up on the page.

`<title>`
: The title of your page. This is what shows up on the tab in your browser, and will be the title of your website in Google search results too.

`<body>`
: The contents of your page. Everything you want to show on screen will go in here.

`<h1>`
: The most important heading on the page. You should only have one of these and it will usually say something similar to the `<title>`. If your page is an article, the article title will be an `<h1>`.

`<p>`
: A paragraph. Most of your text will go in these.

`<ul>`
: An unordered list, showing up as bullet points.

`<li>`
: A list item. These are the only thing that can be inside lists, and in a `<ul>` this will show up as a single bullet item.

## Putting them all together

```html numbered
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Why I like to travel</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Why I like to travel all year long</h1>

    <p>
      I love being able to go to new places and
      see new things. As soon as I don't have
      somewhere to be for work, you'll find me
      headed to the airport with my suitcase in
      hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are three reasons I like to travel:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>I can try new foods.</li>
      <li>I can meet new people.</li>
      <li>I have a chance to see the world.</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

Write this code in a text file, like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac, and save as `mywebsite.html`. Then open it in your web browser

![A screenshot of a website with the below contents](/images/html-101_2021-06-23-21-55-57.png)

Notice the tab has the same text as in our `<title>` tag,
we have one heading, two paragraphs, and one list with three bullets, exactly like the HTML describes.

There are a few different ways to write tags. Most of them are relics of an older time that work in certain places because if we stopped supporting them, older websites would break.

I will cover them anyway so that you recognize them when you see them, but you can safely avoid writing them in your own code if you want to keep it simple.

## Opening, closing, and self-closing

The first rule is that tags that have contents should open with `<tag>` and close with `</tag>` and the contents go inside.

The second rule is to use `<tag />` to self-close tags without contents

Those three types of tags: opening, closing, and self-closing, **are the only ones you need to write**, and those rules will cover you in all circumstances.

A `<p>` tag, marking a paragraph, isn't very useful without text inside, so you will almost always see that open and close.

An `<img>` tag however, marks an image, and it won't have contents so you can make it self-closing.

```html
<p>This is my cat</p>
<img
  src="https://placekitten.com/240/240"
  alt="cat"
/>
```

<div className="rounded border p-4">
  <p>This is my cat</p>
  <img
    src="https://placekitten.com/240/240"
    alt="cat"
  />
</div>

## Case sensitivity

HTML is not case sensitive, so `<BODY>` and `<body>` are equally valid. Uppercase tags were popular historically, but almost everyone sticks to lowercase these days.

## Void elements

The `<img>` element is in fact called a [void element](./html-void-elements) and cannot have children

These cannot have any content, and cannot have separate closing tags. Closing a void element like this is invalid html.

```html
<!-- this is invalid and bad  -->
<img alt></img>


<!-- these are both ok -->
<img alt>
<img alt />
```

In the past, the only way to write an img tag was to use `<img>` with no closing tag. Now, it's ok to make it self closing for consistency

## Optional closing tags

The `<head>` element and the `<p>` element and a few others actually have [optional closing tags](./html-optional-closing-elements). They are only allowed specific contents, so the browsers can intuit on their own where the closing tag should be.

```html
<!-- this is valid but bad  -->
<p>Welcome to my blog</p>
<p>Here are a list of my posts</p>

<ul>
  <li>My first post</li>
  <li>My second post</li>
  <li>My third post</li>
</ul>
```

In my life I have never seen anyone write code like this professionally. Most people have never heard of this, and many whom I tell about it say that they were happier not knowing it was a thing.

Consider this to be HTML trivia and leave it at that

Create a new `page.html` file in a text editor (TextEdit on Mac, Notepad on Windows, or whichever you prefer) and open it in your browser. Every time you update the file and save, you can see the changes by refreshing your browser.<SideNote>The line `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser this is a modern HTML document and that's how it should be read. There are other doc types for XML or older versions of HTML, but this is the only one you'll need to know now. It always goes on the first line before the `<html>` tag.</SideNote>

```html numbered labeled filename[page.html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Cheeto</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Cheeto</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

![](/images/html-for-beginners-03_2021-06-24-17-10-50.png)

## Changing the font

Inside the `<head>`, add a `<style>` tag to change the font.

```html labeled filename[page.html]
<head>
  <title>Cheeto</title>

  <style>
    html {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

![](/images/html-for-beginners-03_2021-06-24-17-17-12.png)

The `<style>` tag is for including CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in your website.

CSS is a different language from HTML and makes up one of the three pillars of web development (along with Javascript). With CSS you can set rules for how your site should look.

A CSS rule is written this way

```css
tag {
  property: value;
}
```

The CSS we wrote above can be read as "The `<html>` tag should choose its `font-family` from the default sans-serif font."

You can be more specific.

```css
html {
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

This rule will choose Helvetica if it's available, otherwise Arial, and falling back to the default sans-serif otherwise.

Add an `<img>`<SideNote>[PlaceKitten](https://placekitten.com/) is one of many placeholder image services. You can use any link to any image here.</SideNote> tag to your `<body>` just after the heading

```html labeled filename[page.html]
<body>
  <h1>Cheeto</h1>

  <img
    src="https://placekitten.com/200/200"
    alt="cat"
    width="200"
    height="200"
  />
</body>
```

![](/images/html-for-beginners-04_2021-06-24-17-59-13.png)

## The img tag

This `<img>` tag has two **attributes**, one named `src` and one named `alt`.

src
: The source of the image, usually written as a URL.

alt
: The alternative text to display if the image cannot load or if the user is viewing your site in a way that doesn't support images, like old mobile browsers, poor internet connections, screen readers, Siri type assistants, and so on. **The alt attribute is mandatory**, and should be left blank (`alt=""`) for decorative images.

width/height
: The width and height of the image, in display pixels. Before the image loads, the page will reserve this much space for it, so the layout doesn't jitter around as the images load.

## Attributes

Attributes are a way of supplying additional information to an element. Almost everyone writes them with double quotes, but single is also valid. **I recommend sticking to double quotes**, if only to avoid having to listen to loud incorrect people tell you you're wrong.

```html
<span class="icon" id="close"> X </span>
```

To tell the browser that your website is in English, which helps assistive software make assumptions and helps search results rank you for English searches (both good things), add the `lang` attribute to your `<html>` tag.

```html numbered labeled filename[page.html] {2}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Cheeto</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

The web wouldn't be a web if you couldn't get from one page to another. We do that with links.

```js numbered {9-14}
<body>
  <h1>Cheeto</h1>

  <img
    src="https://placekitten.com/200/200"
    alt="cat"
  />

  <p>
    Cheeto is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">
      cat
    </a>
  </p>
</body>
```

![Screenshot of website rendering above code, where text "Cheeto is a cat" has the word "cat" underlined and blue, while a tooltip suggests it's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Cat](/images/html-for-beginners-05_2021-07-08-11-11-23.png)

## The anchor tag

`<a>`
: The **anchor** tag links content to somewhere else. That can be another part of the same page, a different page on the same website, a different website, an app, an email client<SideNote>If you've ever clicked an email address link and then had to wait a minute while your computer finished loading your email client so you could then close the email client, copy the address, and manually navigate to Gmail to paste it into the `to` field, you have witnessed an anchor tag linking to `mailto:email@example.com`.</SideNote>, a phone number, or one of many more places.

You set the destination for your link with the `href` attribute, and the content you're trying to make linkable goes between the `<a>` tags.

## Image links

Links don't have to be just text. Images and other elements are perfectly valid children of `<a>` tags. Just as we made the text `cat` clickable in the last example, the same could be done with the image.

```html numbered {4,9}
<body>
  <h1>Cheeto</h1>

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">
    <img
      src="https://placekitten.com/200/200"
      alt="cat"
    />
  </a>

  <p>Cheeto is a cat</p>
</body>
```

Now, clicking on the image will take you to the Wikipedia page.

## Opening links in new tabs

You can open a link in a specific tab by using the `target` attribute.

The `target` attribute specifies the name of the tab to open. Both of the links below have `target="_blank"`, which means clicking one will open in a new tab<SideNote>Leaving out the target attribute means a link will open in the current tab. That's usually a good thing, as it means the user can return using the back button.<br /><br />Consider that links within your site should open in the current tab (with no `target` attribute) and links to external websites should open in new tabs (with a target attribute).</SideNote>.

```html {5,15}
<ul>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Cat
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Dog
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

<ul>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Cat
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Dog
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

You may have noticed the additional attribute `rel="noopener"`. It's important for security to this on any link with a target. If you link to a site without it, that site can open the link from the other end to run arbitrary code on your site. This is an old vulnerability that has existed for a long time.<SideNote>Even if you trust the site you're linking to, there's always the possibility someone malicious could compromise that site in the future, and then you're vulnerable too.</SideNote>

## Internal links

Links with no protocol (the `https://` bit) are **relative links** and are great for linking to different pages within your own website.

```html numbered
<p>
  You can
  <a href="contact.html"> contact Cheeto here </a>
</p>
```

If you try to follow that link it will look for a `contact.html` file in the same directory as your current webpage. Right now there isn't one, and the browser will waste no time telling you. Let's fix that.

Make a new file named `contact.html` and paste the following html.

```html numbered {27}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Contact Cheeto</title>

    <style>
      html {
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Get in touch</h1>

    <p>
      There are several ways to contact Cheeto
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Shouting his name</li>
      <li>Shaking a bag of treats</li>
      <li>Running an electric can opener</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <a href="index.html"> Return to home </a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you named the other html file something other than `index.html`, use that name instead in the **Return to home** link. You should be able to open this file and switch between the two pages<SideNote>If calling this a "website" instead of a "webpage" was bothering you during the period in history where it was only one page, it is now two pages and you can go home.</SideNote> by clicking the link.

![](/images/html-for-beginners-05_2021-07-08-14-21-02.png)

## Hash links

You can link to [specific headings on a page](#internal-links) by specifying the `id` of the heading after the `#` portion of the link.

Every heading on the articles on this site has an id attached, to make it easy for people to share links to specific sections.

```html numbered {1,5}
<h2 id="internal-links">Internal links</h2>

<p>
  You can link to
  <a href="#internal-links">
    specific headings on a page
  </a>
  by specifying the `id` of the heading after the
  `#` portion of the link.
</p>
```

Tabular data belongs in tables. Anything that could go in a spreadsheet should probably belong in a table<SideNote>Ages ago it was common to use tables for the
entire layout of a site because the grid
structure was convenient. Ages ago it was common
for websites to support one specific resolution
on one specific device.<br /><br />These stopped being
common at the same time for the same reason.</SideNote>.

Add this table to your homepage.

```html numbered
<h2>Daily complaints</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Complaint</th>
    <th>Resolution</th>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>05:45</td>
      <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
      <td>None, meowing continues</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:00</td>
      <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
      <td>None, meowing continues</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:15</td>
      <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
      <td>Door opened</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:20</td>
      <td>Hungry</td>
      <td>Food dish was filled</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:25</td>
      <td>Bottom of food dish visible</td>
      <td>Stopped eating, meowing continues</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

![](/images/html-for-beginners-06_2021-07-08-15-21-38.png)

## The `<thead>` and `<th>` tags

The **table head** tag is the first row on the table and is used to label the columns. Each column heading is a **table heading** element, and you'll have one for each column.

```html numbered
<thead>
  <th>Time</th>
  <th>Complaint</th>
  <th>Resolution</th>
</thead>
```

## The `<tr>` and `<td>` tags

The **table row** tag is for every other row on the table, and that's where your data goes. Each cell is a **table definition** element, and they must be in the same order as the heading columns.

The `<th>` tag is just the heading version of the `<td>` tag.

```html numbered
<tr>
  <td>05:45</td>
  <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
  <td>None, meowing continues</td>
</tr>
```

## The table structure

All table tags must be children of a `<table>` element. After the `<thead>` is the `<tbody>`, and all of the non-heading rows must be inside the `<tbody>`.

```html numbered
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <!-- Repeat for more columns  -->
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Column 1</td>
      <!-- Repeat for more columns -->
    </tr>
    <!-- Repeat for more rows  -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

In summary,

HTML is a language used to write the structure of web pages. It's made of tags that can have attributes and contain either text or other elements.

By writing HTML in a `.html` file, browsers are able to read it as a webpage. This is the same way all websites work, although many sites generate the HTML from other code and data from databases rather than having developers write it all manually.

## Tag reference

`<html>`
: Marks the page as an HTML document. This will wrap your entire website, and there is only ever one of these.

`<head>`
: Contains extra information about your site. Nothing inside here ends up on the page.

`<title>`
: The title of your page. This is what shows up on the tab in your browser, and will be the title of your website in Google search results too.

`<body>`
: The contents of your page. Everything you want to show on screen will go in here.

`<h1>`
: The most important heading on the page. You should only have one of these and it will usually say something similar to the `<title>`. If your page is an article, the article title will be an `<h1>`.

`<h2>`
: A heading that divides the page into sections. In an article, most subheadings will be an `<h2>`. If the subheading needs to be split into more specific sections, each of those headings should be an `<h3>`.

`<p>`
: A paragraph. Most of your text will go in these.

`<ul>`
: An unordered list, showing up as bullet points.

`<ol>`
: An ordered list, showing up as numbered items.

`<li>`
: A list item. These are the only thing that can be inside lists. In a `<ul>` this will show up as a single bullet item, and in a `<ol>` this will show up automatically numbered in order.

`<img>`
: An image. Use the `alt` attribute to describe the image, or leave the `alt` attribute blank for decorative images. Point the `src` attribute at the image URL, and set the `width` and `height` attributes the size of the image so the page doesn't jitter around as it loads.

`<style>`
: Contains CSS used for styling the page. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the three pillars of web development.

`<a>`
: An anchor tag that lets you link content to another location on the internet. The `href` attribute contains the URL you are linking to.

`<table>`
: An HTML table for displaying data, not to be used for the layout of your webpage. Contains the `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` elements, as well as several other table related ones that aren't covered here.
