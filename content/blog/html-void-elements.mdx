HTML has several **void** elements.

- `<br>`
- `<hr>`
- `<img>`
- `<input>`
- `<link>`
- `<meta>`
- `<area>`
- `<base>`
- `<col>`
- `<embed>`
- `<param>`
- `<source>`
- `<track>`

These cannot have any content, and cannot have separate closing tags. Closing a void element like this is invalid html.

```html
<img alt></img>
```

Void elements can optionally be self-closing, so these are both correct.

```html
<img alt>

<img alt />
```
