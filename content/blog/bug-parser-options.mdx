TL:DR: Add the file to the "include" array in your tsconfig.json

While setting up Typescript with ESLint, I came across this issue

```
Parsing error: "parserOptions.project" has been set for @typescript-eslint/parser.
The file does not match your project config: babel.config.js.
The file must be included in at least one of the projects provided
```

To debug this, I started with the `eslintrc.js` file where parserOptions was set

```js
module.exports = {
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 2020,
    sourceType: "module",
    project: './tsconfig.json', // The error starts here
  },
```

That field is supposed to point at the `tsconfig.json`, so it looks correct, but maybe the bug is in that file. I'm only using the typescript engine for static analysis, like an advanced linter, so my `tsconfig` was a bit immature.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "checkJs": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    },
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": [".eslintrc.js", "./app/**/*"]
}
```

> The file does not match your project config: babel.config.js.
> The file must be included in at least one of the projects provided

Since this is the `tsconfig.json` that the `eslintrc.js` `project` field pointed to, I appear to be in the right place and can eliminate all of those words from the error message.

> The file does not match your project config: babel.config.js.
> The file must be included

I see an `include` array that does not contain this file

```diff
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "checkJs": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    },
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": [
    ".eslintrc.js",
    "./app/**/*",
+   "./babel.config.js",
+   "./jest.config.js"
  ]
}
```

I was also getting the error for `jest.config.js`, so I added that one as well. After restarting `eslint`, the error has gone away, so this fix appears to be succesful.
