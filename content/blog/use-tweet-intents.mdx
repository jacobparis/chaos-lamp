Tweet intents are links that immediately prompt the user to do something when they visit your page. These are the ones I like to use.

## Prompt to follow

## Prompt to tweet

If you are sharing a link, don't include any conversational text. You _can_, but don't. No one wants to be the mouthpiece for your marketing copy, so all you're doing is increasing the burden of tweeting because they'll have to remove the text.
