When working with CSS Grid, nesting elements can break the layout.

```js numbered
const gridData = data.map(
  ({ id, firstName, lastName, team }) => {
    return (
      <>
        <span>{firstName}</span>
        <span>{lastName}</span>
        <span>{team}</span>
      </>
    )
  },
)
```

This function uses the `<>` fragment shorthand to return three `<span>` elements. With some CSS magic, it works great! But React will say that every element created in a loop needs a key.

The easy way to add the key is to add it to the parent, but since `<key={id}>` is an obvious syntax error, what can be done? Wrapping it in a `<div key={id}` solves the key issue but breaks the layout.

```js numbered {4, 8}
const gridData = data.map(
  ({ id, firstName, lastName, team }) => {
    return (
      <div key={id}>
        <span>{firstName}</span>
        <span>{lastName}</span>
        <span>{team}</span>
      </div>
    )
  },
)
```

One solution is to add keys directly to each child. Since keys need to be unique, you can tag each one with the field name it corresponds to. This is a perfectly valid solution

```js
const gridData = data.map(
  ({ id, firstName, lastName, team }) => {
    return (
      <>
        <span key={`${id}:firstName`}>
          {player.firstName}
        </span>
        <span key={`${id}:lastName`}>
          {player.lastName}
        </span>
        <span key={`${id}:team`}>
          {player.team}
        </span>
      </>
    )
  },
)
```

But â€“ as it turns out, the long-form `React.Fragment` has no problem accepting props<SideNote>The only props that are valid for a React.Fragment are `key` and `children`, as noted in the [source code here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react/src/jsx/ReactJSXElementValidator.js#L281)</SideNote>, and we can just key on that instead.

```js
const gridData = data.map(
  ({ id, firstName, lastName, team }) => {
    return (
      <React.Fragment key={id}>
        <span>{firstName}</span>
        <span>{lastName}</span>
        <span>{team}</span>
      </React.Fragment>
    )
  },
)
```
