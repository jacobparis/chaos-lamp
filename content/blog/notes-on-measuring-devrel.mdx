These are my highlights and notes from [Measuring Developer Relations](https://www.swyx.io/measuring-devrel) from [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)

<Excerpt>
  Your North Star metric is “monthly active developers”. If growth is
  accelerating, good. If growth is constant, fine. If growth is 0% or worse then
  whatever you are doing isn’t working.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  MAD is multi-causal and a lagging indicator so you need leading indicators
  which you have more direct control over.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Unhappiness arises when there is an expectations mismatch between what the
  company wants out of DevRel and what each DevRel is naturally good at.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  There are three emerging sub-specialities of developer relations:
  community-focused, content-focused, and product-focused.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  the ratio of this two way street traffic is 99% outbound and 1% inbound,
  because the product/engineering orgs haven’t set aside any bandwidth for
  “shadow PM-ing” from devrel and all of devrel’s metrics are outbound focused
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  a typical developer content creator’s CPM is $5, a normal devrel’s CPM is
  $50-$ 100. In other words you are paying 10-20x more to make content
  “in-house” than just paying a “professional” to make something about you.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  you have to provide some other form of value than raw anonymous reach. This
  can be: depth, breadth, consistency, access, insight, community, email list
  building, etc.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  you have to [sell features, not
  benefits](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1361279902889086980)
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Try [the Sean Ellis
  question](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit#anchoring-around-a-metric-a-leading-indicator-for-productmarket-fit)
  instead: “How would you feel if you could no longer use the product/be part of
  the community/read this content?” and use it as a way to segment/understand
  your audience
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  You are hereby banned from suggesting to A/B test anything if you do not have
  the traffic or the infrastructure to easily implement an A/B test like 90% of
  devtools startups
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  People are waking up to the lasting power of community and now [Technical
  Community Builder is the Hottest New Job in
  Tech](https://dev.to/dx/technical-community-builder-is-the-hottest-new-job-in-tech-8cl).
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
Community metrics that I like (pick 1-3):

- Number of active members in Slack/Discord
- Number of weekly new topics in Discourse/StackOverflow/GitHub Discussions
- Number of user contributions (whether it is PRs, questions, answers, blogposts, meetup talks, etc)
- Number of [Orbit level 1](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model) users
- Number of events and number of attendees
- Number of engaged “superusers”

</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Beware the optics of regularly asking your users to do free work for you,
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>…most company “communities” are really just support forums</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>Having great content is often the “minimal viable community”.</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  One definition of a good community is that people expect their association
  with your project/product to outlast their current employment
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>&ldquo;forums and chats are “cold”, events are “hot”</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  We had a Principal DevRel whose primary job was to help organize our 3
  conferences (together with Marketing) and their associated community. If he
  did nothing else but that, he would already have been worth his weight in gold
  to us.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  develop a sense of what kinds of things win hackathons — anything realtime
  (because a live demo can include the audience), anything phone based (everyone
  has a phone), anything AI based (people like seeing machines act like people),
  anything visual design
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  A small group of highly engaged fans can make a community feel more alive than
  a large group of passive users.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  [Runa Capital has a definition of Active
  Contributors](https://medium.com/runacapital/open-source-analysis-and-os-databases-1eb1fe840719),
  and the big dogs go up to 200 regular contributors a year.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Devrel scales by how it enables users to tell (even brag to) each other about
  their usage.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  How do you bring your community closer in touch with your engineers?
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>&ldquo;How can you help your users hire each other?</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  I recommend producing at least 1 piece of content on your company a week
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
&ldquo;Content metrics that I like (in rough order):

- Number of Newsletter subscribers
- Number of YouTube subscribers
- Number of Twitter follows
- Number of Workshop completions
- Number of Conference/meetup appearances
- [SEO Domain Authority](https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority)

</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
As a content creator you have the choice between [TOFU, MOFU, and BOFU content](https://swyx.transistor.fm/episodes/tofu-mofu-and-bofu-content):

- Top of Funnel: never heard of you (Awareness)
- Middle of Funnel: comparing you to others and learning basic features/concepts (Evaluation)
- Bottom of Funnel: deciding to buy and put you into production (Conversion)

</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  If you only measure website traffic then you naturally incentivize DevRel to
  create clickbait TOFU that doesn’t have to convert at all and alienate your
  biggest fans.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Newsletter signup (incentivized by great company blogposts and updates) keeps
  you honest.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Most marketers and professional creators view 1 email subscriber to be worth
  between 100-1000 social media followers.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
&ldquo;The more seriously you view yourself as ”building a media-company-within-a-company” rather than “doing some content marketing”, the better you will do.

</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  How long until a piece of content gets half of the views it will ever get in
  its lifetime. Twitter’s half-life is hours, YouTube’s half-life is months,
  blog is years. Create accordingly.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
&ldquo;Test things on more ephemeral media before developing them further on more permanent media.

</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Managers think they are helping by establishing content calendars. I have
  never seen a DevRel operation stick to these beyond month 1
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  …for YouTube, the recommendation algorithm does reward weekly output
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  5-10 million developers on YouTube (my estimate). There are between 1-2
  million developers on Twitter (my estimate). There are about [6 million
  developers on Hacker
  News](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1422043347011600386?s=20).
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
&ldquo;…best way to get started is just [default to consistency](https://www.swyx.io/quality-vs-consistency/)

</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Workshops are extremely underrated forms of content for achieving depth
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  It’s well worth producing 1-2 great conference talks a year at high profile
  events, and sometimes to get there, you need to practice and iterate at 5-10
  smaller venues, but anything beyond that probably has diminished returns
  compared to anything else you could be doing.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Being able to give the same elevator pitch over and over again at different
  meetups can be great for capturing the attention of a small set of developers.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Raw # of meetup appearances is probably a good enough metric here.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Most developers discover solutions more by hearing about them from friends and
  thoughtleaders than by searching
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Auth0 and Digital Ocean famously prioritized an SEO based approach, however
  your devtool/brand should be general enough for this to work.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  who owns example repos and code samples and keeps them up to date?
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  are you creating content because your docs aren’t clear enough? are you
  creating docs because your product isn’t intuitive? All content ultimately has
  a half-life — sometimes you have to go downstream to fix root cause
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
Product metrics that I like:

- Number of launch day users, and positive launch day mentions
- Number of prioritized user issues from DevRel
- Number of monthly users of integrations/tooling
- [the Seanl Ellis question](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit#anchoring-around-a-metric-a-leading-indicator-for-productmarket-fit) (over NPS) for integrations/tooling managed by devrel

</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  [Gustaf Alstromer’s PMF measure](https://youtu.be/T9ikpoF2GH0?t=958): Value
  metric, and % retention at ideal recurring frequency
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Devrels can provide tremendous value in the lead up to any product launch by
  beta testing (either personally or with users), or creating
  eyecatching/inspiring demos, blogposts, and videos for launch day/annual
  conference.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Devrel are also often responsible for maintaining non-core integrations and
  helper tooling.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Netlify has an entire [Integrations
  Engineering](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/01/06/developer-experience-at-netlify/)
  team.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  Solutions Engineering: where you help out with customer-specific custom demos
  and integration work. For large enough customers and small enough startups
  this is fine, but the bulk of the DevRel effort should focus on work that
  scales.
</Excerpt>

<Excerpt>
  many CTOs and VP Engs recommend a multiyear adoption path especially for core
  tech. Traditional marketing advice says people have to hear about you at least
  7 times before they decide to buy; for developer tools, Matt Biilmann from
  Netlify says it’s more like 14.
</Excerpt>
