With a large existing codebase, adding a tool like Prettier can be daunting. Any branch existing before the Prettier refactor will be filled with merge conflicts, and this is often enough to make a team decide against using it entirely.

That would be a mistake.

Formatting code manually is a way of tricking yourself into thinking you're spending time improving the codebase while providing zero business value.

Fortunately, there is a solution.

By adding a `.prettierignore` file, you can stop Prettier from formatting certain files and directories.

```yml
# Ignore everything:
/**/*.*
```

It's important to target only files `*.*` and not directories, as [you cannot "un-ignore" the child of an ignored directory](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).

> An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined.

To selectively enable Prettier for every file underneath a `__tests__` directory, you can add another rule to target those.

```yml
# Ignore everything:
/**/*.*


# Except tests:
!/**/__tests__/**/*.*
```
