In summary,

HTML is a language used to write the structure of web pages. It's made of tags that can have attributes and contain either text or other elements.

By writing HTML in a `.html` file, browsers are able to read it as a webpage. This is the same way all websites work, although many sites generate the HTML from other code and data from databases rather than having developers write it all manually.

## Tag reference

`<html>`
: Marks the page as an HTML document. This will wrap your entire website, and there is only ever one of these.

`<head>`
: Contains extra information about your site. Nothing inside here ends up on the page.

`<title>`
: The title of your page. This is what shows up on the tab in your browser, and will be the title of your website in Google search results too.

`<body>`
: The contents of your page. Everything you want to show on screen will go in here.

`<h1>`
: The most important heading on the page. You should only have one of these and it will usually say something similar to the `<title>`. If your page is an article, the article title will be an `<h1>`.

`<h2>`
: A heading that divides the page into sections. In an article, most subheadings will be an `<h2>`. If the subheading needs to be split into more specific sections, each of those headings should be an `<h3>`.

`<p>`
: A paragraph. Most of your text will go in these.

`<ul>`
: An unordered list, showing up as bullet points.

`<ol>`
: An ordered list, showing up as numbered items.

`<li>`
: A list item. These are the only thing that can be inside lists. In a `<ul>` this will show up as a single bullet item, and in a `<ol>` this will show up automatically numbered in order.

`<img>`
: An image. Use the `alt` attribute to describe the image, or leave the `alt` attribute blank for decorative images. Point the `src` attribute at the image URL, and set the `width` and `height` attributes the size of the image so the page doesn't jitter around as it loads.

`<style>`
: Contains CSS used for styling the page. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the three pillars of web development.

`<a>`
: An anchor tag that lets you link content to another location on the internet. The `href` attribute contains the URL you are linking to.

`<table>`
: An HTML table for displaying data, not to be used for the layout of your webpage. Contains the `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` elements, as well as several other table related ones that aren't covered here.
