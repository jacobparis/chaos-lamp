There are two things you need to know about in order to write queries: type definitions, and resolvers

Here is a simple query to get a list of user emails

```js
  query { # the "query" field
    users { # the "users" field
      email # the "email" field
    }
  }
```

There are two top-level fields, and each request should be one or the other. That means every request is a `query` or a `mutation`. To make fields that work for queries, define them under `type Query`

## The type definitions

Type definitions allow us to describe how we want this query to look. The above query expects that under `type Query` is a field named `users` whose resolver returns something with a field `email`

```js
const typedefs = gql`
  type Query {
    users: [User]
  }
`
```

The field needs both a name (in this case `users`) and a return type (in this case an array of User types). We're only trying to query the email, so the User type only needs an email field.

```diff
const typedefs = gql`
  type Query {
    users: [User]
  }

+ type User {
+   email: String
+ }
`
```

## The resolvers

Resolvers are functions that trigger when a field is queried.

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users() {
      return [
        {id: 0, email: 'alice@example.com'},
        {id: 1, email: 'bob@example.com'},
        {id: 2, email: 'carol@example.com'},
        {id: 3, email: 'doug@example.com'},
        {id: 4, email: 'eve@example.com'},
      ]
    },
  },

  User: {
    email(user) {
      return user.email
    },
  },
}
```

With the above resolver set up, running a **query** on **users** will load the list of users and pass it down to the **email** resolver that returns each email

```js
query {
  users {
    email
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {"email": "alice@example.com"},
      {"email": "bob@example.com"},
      {"email": "carol@example.com"},
      {"email": "doug@example.com"},
      {"email": "eve@example.com"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Simple resolvers

Since returning a field of an object with the same name as the resolver is such a common use-case, GraphQL does not require us to specify these manually. Any resolver we don't declare will be assumed to be one of these simple resolvers.

The email resolver just returns the email property, so we are ok to leave that one out.

```js
const typedefs = gql`
  type Query {
    users: [User]
  }

  type User {
    email: String
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users() {
      return [
        {id: 0, email: 'alice@example.com'},
        {id: 1, email: 'bob@example.com'},
        {id: 2, email: 'carol@example.com'},
        {id: 3, email: 'doug@example.com'},
        {id: 4, email: 'eve@example.com'},
      ]
    },
  },
}
```
