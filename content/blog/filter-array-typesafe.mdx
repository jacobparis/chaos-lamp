I had a typed array and wanted to remove elements with an empty value. In vanilla Javascript that's easy enough, but instead of regular strings I was using string unions to restrict the available options.

```ts numbered {40}
type Property = {
  measurements: Measurement[]
}

type Measurement = {
  type: MeasurementType
  value: number
  unit: MeasurementUnit
}

type MeasurementType =
  | 'LOT_DEPTH'
  | 'LOT_AREA'
  | 'LIVING_AREA'

type MeasurementUnit =
  | 'SQUARE_FEET'
  | 'SQUARE_METERS'
  | 'FEET'
  | 'METERS'

function getProperty(input): Property {
  return {
    measurements: [
      {
        type: 'LOT_DEPTH',
        value: input.lotDepth.value,
        unit: input.lotDepth.unit,
      },
      {
        type: 'LOT_AREA',
        value: input.lotArea.value,
        unit: input.lotArea.unit,
      },
      {
        type: 'LIVING_AREA',
        value: input.livingArea.value,
        unit: input.livingArea.unit,
      },
    ].filter((measurement) => measurement.value),
  }
}
```

Typescript was able to correctly infer the type of the `measurements` array, but as soon as I added the `filter` it broke. Why? Filter returns a regular array of regular objects, and the type information about the string unions was lost

```
Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'MeasurementName'
```

## Solutions

The solution I ended up going with was to use type predicates to tell filter which type to use. I found out afterward that TS can infer correctly without the type predicate as long as it's split with an intermediate variable.

### Type predicates

```ts
.filter((measurement): measurement is Measurement  => measurement.value)
```

### Type predicates (JSDoc)

```js
.filter(/** @type function(*): measurement is Measurement */ (measurement) => measurement.value)
```

### Intermediate variable (JSDoc)

```js
function getProperty(input): Property {
  /** @type {Measurement[]} */
  const measurements = [
    {
      type: 'LOT_DEPTH',
      value: input.lotDepth.value,
      unit: input.lotDepth.unit,
    },
    {
      type: 'LOT_AREA',
      value: input.lotArea.value,
      unit: input.lotArea.unit,
    },
    {
      type: 'LIVING_AREA',
      value: input.livingArea.value,
      unit: input.livingArea.unit,
    },
  ]

  return {
    measurements: measurements.filter(
      (measurement) => measurement.value,
    ),
  }
}
```
