The web wouldn't be a web if you couldn't get from one page to another. We do that with links.

```js numbered {9-14}
<body>
  <h1>Cheeto</h1>

  <img
    src="https://placekitten.com/200/200"
    alt="cat"
  />

  <p>
    Cheeto is a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">
      cat
    </a>
  </p>
</body>
```

## The anchor tag

`<a>`
: The **anchor** tag links content to somewhere else. That can be another part of the same page, a different page on the same website, a different website, an app, an email client, a phone number, or one of many more places.

<SideNote>

If you've ever clicked an email address link and then had to wait a minute while your computer finished loading your email client so you could then close the email client, copy the address, and manually navigate to Gmail to paste it into the `to` field, you have witnessed an anchor tag linking to `mailto:email@example.com`.

Websites are often written by developers who will never use them and paid for by executives who won't either, and only this fact explains why anyone could think a `mailto` link is a good idea.

</SideNote>

You set the destination for your link with the `href` attribute, and the content you're trying to make linkable goes between the `<a>` tags.

## Image links

Links don't have to be just text. Images and other elements are perfectly valid children of `<a>` tags. Just as we made the text `cat` clickable in the last example, the same could be done with the image.

```html numbered {4,9}
<body>
  <h1>Cheeto</h1>

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">
    <img
      src="https://placekitten.com/200/200"
      alt="cat"
    />
  </a>

  <p>Cheeto is a cat</p>
</body>
```

Now, clicking on the image will take you to the Wikipedia page.

## Opening links in new tabs

You can open a link in a specific tab by using the `target` attribute.

<SideNote>

Leaving out the target attribute means a link will open in the current tab. That's usually a good thing, as it means the user can return using the back button.

If you don't have strong opinions on the matter, consider using new tabs for new websites. Links within your site should open in the current tab (with no `target` attribute) and links to external websites should open in new tabs (with a target attribute).

</SideNote>

The `target` attribute specifies the name of the tab to open. Both of the links below have `target="_blank"`, which means clicking one will open in a new tab.

```html {5,15}
<ul>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Cat
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Dog
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

<ul>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Cat
    </a>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
    >
      Dog
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<SideNote>

You may have noticed the additional attribute `rel="noopener"`. It's important for security to this on any link with a target. If you link to a site without it, that site can open the link from the other end to run arbitrary code on your site. This is an old vulnerability that has existed for a long time.

Even if you trust the site you're linking to, there's always the possibility someone malicious could compromise that site in the future, and then you're vulnerable too.

</SideNote>

## Internal links

Links with no protocol (the `https://` bit) are **relative links** and are great for linking to different pages within your own website.

```html numbered
<p>
  You can
  <a href="contact.html"> contact Cheeto here </a>
</p>
```

If you try to follow that link it will look for a `contact.html` file in the same directory as your current webpage. Right now there isn't one, and the browser will waste no time telling you. Let's fix that.

Make a new file named `contact.html` and paste the following html.

```html numbered {27}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Contact Cheeto</title>

    <style>
      html {
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Get in touch</h1>

    <p>
      There are several ways to contact Cheeto
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Shouting his name</li>
      <li>Shaking a bag of treats</li>
      <li>Running an electric can opener</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <a href="index.html"> Return to home </a>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you named the other html file something other than `index.html`, use that name instead in the **Return to home** link. You should be able to open this file and switch between the two pages by clicking the link.

<SideNote>

**Footnote for pedants:** If calling this a "website" instead of a "webpage" was bothering you during the period in history where it was only one page, it is now two pages and you can go home.

</SideNote>

## Hash links

You can link to [specific headings on a page](#internal-links) by specifying the `id` of the heading after the `#` portion of the link.

Every heading on the articles on this site has an id attached, to make it easy for people to share links to specific sections.

```html numbered {1,5}
<h2 id="internal-links">Internal links</h2>

<p>
  You can link to
  <a href="#internal-links">
    specific headings on a page
  </a>
  by specifying the `id` of the heading after the
  `#` portion of the link.
</p>
```
