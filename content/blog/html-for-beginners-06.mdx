Tabular data belongs in tables. Anything that could go in a spreadsheet should probably belong in a table.

Add this table to your homepage.

```html numbered
<h2>Daily complaints</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Complaint</th>
    <th>Resolution</th>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>05:45</td>
      <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
      <td>None, meowing continues</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:00</td>
      <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
      <td>None, meowing continues</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:15</td>
      <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
      <td>Door opened</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:20</td>
      <td>Hungry</td>
      <td>Food dish was filled</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>06:25</td>
      <td>Bottom of food dish visible</td>
      <td>Stopped eating, meowing continues</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

<SideNote>

Ages ago it was common to use tables for the
entire layout of a site because the grid
structure was convenient. Ages ago it was common
for websites to support one specific resolution
on one specific device.

These stopped being
common at the same time for the same reason.

</SideNote>

## The `<thead>` and `<th>` tags

The **table head** tag is the first row on the table and is used to label the columns. Each column heading is a **table heading** element, and you'll have one for each column.

```html numbered
<thead>
  <th>Time</th>
  <th>Complaint</th>
  <th>Resolution</th>
</thead>
```

## The `<tr>` and `<td>` tags

The **table row** tag is for every other row on the table, and that's where your data goes. Each cell is a **table definition** element, and they must be in the same order as the heading columns.

The `<th>` tag is just the heading version of the `<td>` tag.

```html numbered
<tr>
  <td>05:45</td>
  <td>Bedroom door was closed</td>
  <td>None, meowing continues</td>
</tr>
```

## The table structure

All table tags must be children of a `<table>` element. After the `<thead>` is the `<tbody>`, and all of the non-heading rows must be inside the `<tbody>`.

```html numbered
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <!-- Repeat for more columns  -->
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Column 1</td>
      <!-- Repeat for more columns -->
    </tr>
    <!-- Repeat for more rows  -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```
